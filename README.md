## 📌 Notes
- Some folders are removed due to plugin's / member's copyright and unnecessary parts. Such as Plugins, Model Prefab, etc.
- The project might not load properly when open in Unity Editor due to missing folders that mentioned above. So, I suggested to inspect those scripts instead of download the whole folder.
